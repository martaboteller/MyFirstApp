This is the first Android app created during a course entitled <i>Android Application Developer</i> carried out at the CIFO thanks to a grant from the Generalitat of Catalonia and the European Union.

The initial idea of this app has been created by the course organizers. Based on that initial idea I have created my own version of MyFirstApp (in Android).

## Getting Started

This project has been made using AndroidStudio 3.5 and tested on a Pixel 2 XL API 29 emulator. 

This first app has been useful to understand the MVC (Model View Controller) design and what is the process that follows an activity.

We have started learning to use the <i> drawable </i> folder with an <i>xml</i> file that defines a border format.
And inside the resources folder a <i> strings.xml </i> file has been created containing the view's elements name.     

&nbsp;

Special attention has been given to the adaptation of the <i> activity_main.xml </i> layout to the horizontal and landscape orientation views. Always defining all needed constrains using a ConstraintLayout for this case.

&nbsp;

## Deployment

With this application two kind of texts are displayed on a TextView depending on a pressed button: "Consells (Advices)" or "Frases Fetes (Set Phrases)". As soon as the text is displayed a "more" icon is shown giving access to the second activity (FraseDetailActivity.java). 

In the second screen more detailed information is shown related to a specific phrase: Id, Author and Text.

Several ImageViews have been added together with an app Icon. 

Special attention has been paid to the display's adaptation depending on several resolutions (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi).
