This is the first Android app created during a course entitled <i>Android Application Developer</i> carried out at the CIFO thanks to a grant from the Generalitat of Catalonia and the European Union.

The initial idea of this app has been created by the course organizers. Based on that initial idea I have created my own version of MyFirstApp (in Android). 

With this application two kind of texts are displayed depending on a pressed button: "Consells (Advices)" or "Frases Fetes (Set Phrases)".
